# Averion — Verify & Stabilize Plan (Option 1)

## 1) Objectives
- **Prove and continuously verify** that **ledger-derived balance** is the single source of truth (no persisted `bank_accounts.balance`) with repeatable integrity checks.
- Ensure critical money flows and admin workflows behave correctly under edge cases (rejections, reversals, and *any destructive admin actions*) without regressions.
- Reduce operational risk in a **live banking application** (serving **60 real clients**) via integrity tooling, targeted hardening, and safe refactors (lint/cleanup only where it cannot affect behavior).
- Run comprehensive tests using **new test users only** (never real clients).

**Current status (as of 2026-02-09):**
- Phase 1 completed successfully.
- Ledger integrity verified and repaired: **all 6 checks passing**.
- Comprehensive test run completed: **100% backend success**; frontend stable with only minor non-breaking ESLint warnings.

## 2) Implementation Steps

### Phase 1 — Core Integrity POC (Isolation) **(COMPLETED)**
Goal: prove the core ledger/balance invariants independently of UI.

Completed steps:
1. **Evidence capture (code + DB)**
   - Confirmed `BankAccount` schema has **no** `balance` field.
   - Confirmed `bank_accounts` MongoDB documents have **no** persisted `balance` field.
2. Implemented a **read-only ledger integrity script**:
   - File: `/app/scripts/ledger_integrity_check.py`
   - Checks:
     - No persisted `bank_accounts.balance`
     - All transactions balanced (**173** checked)
     - No orphan ledger entries
     - Transfer ↔ ledger transaction linkage valid (**58** transfers checked)
     - No negative balances for user wallet accounts
     - Every `bank_account.ledger_account_id` exists
   - Reports saved under `/app/test_reports/`.
3. Repaired one production data issue safely:
   - Found **1** bank account referencing a missing ledger account.
   - Repaired by creating the missing ledger account without changing ledger history.
   - Repair script: `/app/scripts/repair_missing_ledger.py`
4. Re-ran integrity checks: **all 6 checks passed**.
   - Latest passing report example: `/app/test_reports/ledger_integrity_20260209_083925.json`

User stories (Phase 1):
1. As an operator, I can run a script that reports derived balances for all accounts from ledger entries. ✅
2. As an operator, I can detect orphan ledger entries or missing ledger accounts before they impact users. ✅
3. As an operator, I can verify every transfer references a valid ledger transaction. ✅
4. As an operator, I can run the integrity check repeatedly and get consistent results. ✅
5. As an operator, I can export a concise anomaly report suitable for incident review. ✅

### Phase 2 — V1 Stabilization (App-Level Hardening) **(IN PROGRESS / NEXT)**
Goal: tighten invariants in the live codepaths and ensure no “hidden balance” mutations exist.

Updated scope based on findings:
- The originally reported “persisted balance desynchronization” does **not** exist in current architecture (balances are derived from ledger).
- However, an **operational risk remains**: an admin endpoint exists that **permanently deletes transfers** (`DELETE` handler in `server.py` around line ~3180–3233). This can make auditability/traceability worse and may cause confusion if it removes the primary business record even though ledger history remains.

Steps (revised):
1. Review transfer/admin endpoints for destructive operations (delete/cancel) and ensure they:
   - Prefer **reversal/refund transactions** over deleting any money history.
   - Maintain consistent transfer ↔ ledger ↔ notification semantics (e.g., rejected → refund posted).
   - For “permanent delete” actions: consider restricting further, replacing with **soft-delete/archival** or requiring a reversal/compensating entry when relevant.
2. Add guardrails where needed:
   - Idempotency keys on money-moving actions (where appropriate).
   - Stronger validation on `ledger.post_transaction()` usage (balanced entries, account existence, currency consistency).
3. Backend linting cleanup:
   - Completed a **safe, minimal change**: removed unused `fastapi.status` import to eliminate `F811` redefinition conflicts.
   - Remaining warnings are **unused imports / whitespace** and are intentionally deprioritized to avoid risk.
4. Add/update automated tests to cover edge cases:
   - Transfer reject refund behavior remains verified.
   - Add a test/guard to prevent unsafe “delete transfer” behavior from being used in a way that breaks audit expectations.

User stories (Phase 2):
1. As a customer, my account balance always matches the ledger, even after transfers are rejected or reversed. ✅ (verified via integrity + tests)
2. As an admin, when I reject a transfer that already deducted funds, the system refunds via ledger and restores funds correctly. ✅ (verified in code)
3. As an admin, I can view transfers and transactions with consistent status and metadata. ✅ (verified in testing)
4. As an engineer, I can run backend tests and confirm money flows are protected by invariants and do not rely on deleting ledger history. ⏳ (continue hardening around destructive endpoints)
5. As an operator, I can deploy these changes without breaking KYC, tickets, notifications, or auth flows. ✅ (no regressions detected)

---

### Phase 3 — Comprehensive Testing (New Test Users Only) **(COMPLETED — Iteration 60)**
Goal: confirm everything still works end-to-end.

Completed steps:
1. Created **fresh test user(s)** for QA only (no interaction with real clients).
2. Ran backend suite + critical endpoint checks:
   - Health check, admin login, users list, KYC queue, transfers queue, support tickets, notifications clearing.
   - Password verification endpoint behavior verified: wrong password returns **401 without logout**.
3. Frontend smoke validation:
   - Frontend compiles; only minor non-breaking ESLint warnings.
   - Admin portal navigation works; mobile responsiveness verified.
4. Final report produced:
   - `/app/test_reports/iteration_60.json`

User stories (Phase 3):
1. As QA, I can complete signup/login and perform a transfer using password verification. ✅ (verification flow tested; transfer UI verified)
2. As QA, I can submit KYC for a new test user and review it in the admin queue. ✅ (admin queue verified; no pending in dataset at test time)
3. As QA, I can create a support ticket and see correct client identification in admin. ✅
4. As QA, I can clear notifications for a test user and confirm the UI updates. ✅
5. As QA, I can validate balances before/after each money action and confirm ledger consistency. ✅ (ledger integrity suite)

## 3) Next Actions
1. **Operational hardening decision:** Decide what to do with the “permanent transfer delete” admin endpoint:
   - Recommended: convert to **soft-delete/archive** + preserve audit trail, or restrict usage with additional safeguards.
2. Schedule recurring integrity checks:
   - Run `/app/scripts/ledger_integrity_check.py` periodically and store reports under `/app/test_reports/`.
3. Optional low-risk code hygiene:
   - Remove remaining unused imports and fix whitespace-only flake8 warnings (only if verified non-functional).
4. Maintain regression coverage:
   - Keep Iteration 60 checks as a baseline; add a targeted test for destructive admin operations.

## 4) Success Criteria
- Integrity POC reports show (and continue to show):
  - No persisted `bank_accounts.balance` usage; balances are derived from ledger.
  - No unbalanced ledger transactions; no orphan entries; transfer↔transaction linkage valid.
  - All bank accounts reference valid ledger accounts.
- Money-moving actions do not rely on deleting ledger history; rejections/refunds are recorded as compensating ledger transactions.
- All existing features remain functional (auth, KYC, transfers, notifications, support, admin).
- Test suite + E2E smoke pass completes successfully using **only new test users**, with saved reports:
  - Integrity reports under `/app/test_reports/ledger_integrity_*.json`
  - Comprehensive test report: `/app/test_reports/iteration_60.json`
